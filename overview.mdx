## Why Apitally?

- Effortlessly monitor API traffic, performance, and errors. Understand usage patterns of individual consumers.
- Easily manage API keys and permissions for your consumers.
- Integrates directly with your application via middleware and does not require rerouting of your API traffic or an agent to be installed seperately. No impact on performance.
- Supports the most popular REST API frameworks in Python through an [open-source client library](https://github.com/apitally/python-client). Support for other languages coming soon.
- Built specifically for small teams or individual developers who value simple architectures and affordable services, but scales comfortably for larger teams too.
